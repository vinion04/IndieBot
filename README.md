# IndieBot
code for my first ever bot made for my discord server

using Python i created and connected my bot 'IndieBot' to my discord server for
my gamedev group. i hope this to be a working project that constantly improves and adds 
features we need along the way.

So far IndieBot:
- displays connection output and members in server
- greets new members
- responds to certain messages 
- assigns strikes to gamedev members that are causing issues

I would like it to:
- be a dj for our gamedev meetings
- set reminders weekly for gamedev meetings
- create polls for gamedev decisions
- and more !

currently hosted on a server using bot-hosting.net
